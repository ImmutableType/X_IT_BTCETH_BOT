2025-01-04,Fruit and Cream Cheese Breakfast Pastries,"Preheat oven to 400¬∫F (200¬∫C), and prepare two cookie sheets with parchment paper. In a bowl, mix cream cheese, sugar, and vanilla until fully combined. Lightly flour the surface and roll out puff pastry on top to flatten. Cut each sheet of puff pastry into 9 equal squares. On the top right and bottom left of the pastry, cut an L shape approximately ¬Ω inch (1 cm) from the edge.
NOTE: This L shape should reach all the way down and across the square, however both L shapes should not meet at the ends. Your pastry should look like a picture frame with two corners still intact.
Take the upper right corner and fold down towards the inner bottom corner. You will now have a diamond shape.
Place 1 to 2 teaspoons of the cream cheese filling in the middle, then place berries on top.
Repeat with the remaining pastry squares and place them onto the parchment covered baking sheet.
Bake for 15-20 minutes or until pastry is golden brown and puffed.
Enjoy!

2025-01-04,Ros√≥≈Ç (Polish Chicken Soup),"Add chicken to a large Dutch oven or stock pot 
Cover with water
Bring to a boil and simmer for 2 to 2 1/2 hours, skimming any impurities off the top to insure a clear broth
If your pot is big enough, add the vegetables and spices for the last hour of the cooking time
My Dutch oven wasn‚Äôt big enough to hold everything, just the chicken and other bones filled the pot, so I cooked the meat/bones for the full cooking time, then removed them, and cooked the vegetables and spices separately
Strain everything out of the broth
Bone the chicken, pulling the meat into large chunks
Slice the carrots
Return the chicken and carrots to the broth
Cook noodles according to package instructions if you‚Äôre using them
Add noodles to bowl and then top with hot soup",https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/lx1kkj1593349302.jpg,Yes
2025-01-04,Jam Roly-Poly,"Put a deep roasting tin onto the bottom shelf of the oven, and make sure that there‚Äôs another shelf directly above it. Pull the roasting tin out on its shelf, fill two-thirds with boiling water from the kettle, then carefully slide it back in. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Tear off a large sheet of foil and greaseproof paper (about 30 x 40cm). Sit the greaseproof on top of the foil and butter it.
Tip butter, flour and vanilla seeds into a food processor; pulse until the butter has disappeared. Tip into a mixing bowl. Stir through the suet, pour in the milk and work together with a cutlery knife until you get a sticky dough. You may need a drop more milk, depending on your flour.
Tip the dough out onto a floured surface, quickly pat together to smooth, then roll out to a square roughly 25 x 25cm. Spread the jam all over, leaving a gap along one edge, then roll up from the opposite edge. Pinch the jam-free edge into the dough where it meets, and pinch the ends roughly, too. Carefully lift onto the greased paper, join-side down (you might find a flat baking sheet helpful for this), loosely bring up the paper and foil around it, then scrunch together along the edges and ends to seal. The roly-poly will puff quite a bit during cooking so don‚Äôt wrap it tightly. Lift the parcel directly onto the rack above the tin and cook for 1 hr.
Let the pudding sit for 5 mins before unwrapping, then carefully open the foil and paper, and thickly slice to serve.",https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/ysqupp1511640538.jpg,Yes
2025-01-04,Oxtail with broad beans,"Toss the oxtail with the onion, spring onion, garlic, ginger, chilli, soy sauce, thyme, salt and pepper. Heat the vegetable oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Brown the oxtail in the pan until browned all over, about 10 minutes. Place into a pressure cooker, and pour in 375ml water. Cook at pressure for 25 minutes, then remove from heat, and remove the lid according to manufacturer's directions.
Add the broad beans and pimento berries, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Dissolve the cornflour in 2 tablespoons water, and stir into the simmering oxtail. Cook and stir a few minutes until the sauce has thickened, and the broad beans are tender.",https://www.themealdb.com/images/media/meals/1520083578.jpg,Yes
2025-01-04,Peanut Butter Cookies,"Preheat oven to 350¬∫F (180¬∫C).
In a large bowl, mix together the peanut butter, sugar, and egg.
Scoop out a spoonful of dough and roll it into a ball. Place the cookie balls onto a nonstick baking sheet.
For extra decoration and to make them cook more evenly, flatten the cookie balls by pressing a fork down on top of them, then press it down again at a 90¬∫ angle to make a criss-cross pattern.
Bake for 8-10 minutes or until the bottom of the cookies are golden brown.
Remove from baking sheet and cool.
